# The 8 Queens Problem
The [8 queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle), or generalized as the N queens problem, has the goal of placing 8 (N) queens on an 8x8 (NxN) board, such that no Queen threatens another.

This project solves the 8 Queens problem using Hill Climbing search with and without sideways move, and random restarts. It is written in GO.
